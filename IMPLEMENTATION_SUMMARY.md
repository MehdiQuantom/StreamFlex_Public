2. Update your Supabase credentials in `config/supabaseConfig.ts`
3. Create the database tables using the provided SQL queries

### Video Servers

The app uses three video servers:
- **Server 1** (moviesapi.club) - Free, movies and TV
- **Server 2** (vidsrc.icu) - Free, movies and TV
- **VIP Server** (streamflex.com) - Requires subscription, full series support

For TV series, the URL format is:
```
{server_base}/tv/{movie_id}/{season}/{episode}
```

### Email Verification

By default, Supabase requires email verification:
- Users must verify their email before signing in
- Check spam folder if email doesn't arrive
- Can be disabled in Supabase dashboard for testing

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Supabase** - Follow `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`
2. **Test all features** - Sign up, add favorites, watch content
3. **Customize** - Adjust colors, add more features
4. **Deploy** - Build and deploy your app

## Support
